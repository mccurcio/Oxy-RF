## Title: Generate_500unit_test_harness.rmd

#### Summary: 

It was seen through preliminary work that two problems became immediately appearent.  The first was that IF the files were concatenated they would something on the order of 26MB.  This 26MB file would be too large too run many manny trial of, therefore a test-harness was generated.  The second problem was the wide diversity of samples in each protein class.  The smallest grouping was Leghemoglobin, found in beans, which numbered only 125 proteins while the largest class was Hemerythrin with 40,763 proteins per class.

It was determined that the test-harness should have 500 units per class.  The 500 units would be chosen at random with Leghemoglobin being oversampled by 4:1. The largest class, Hemeerythrin was undersampled, 81.25:1

This script will find the number of lines per file than sample 500 times from each file.  The lines will be .... (concat before or after?)

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

Libraries = c("readr", "seqinr", "stringr", "dplyr")

# Install if not present
for(p in Libraries){
    if(!require(p, character.only = TRUE))
        install.packages(p)
    library(p, character.only = TRUE)
}
